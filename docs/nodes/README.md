# Data Whisperer Workflow Nodes

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Data Whisperer workflow nodes. This documentation provides detailed information about all available node types, their configurations, and best practices for using them effectively.

## Node Categories

Data Whisperer workflow nodes are organized into the following categories:

1. [**Data Source Nodes**](./DATA_SOURCE_NODES.md) - Nodes for loading data from various sources
2. [**Data Preparation Nodes**](./DATA_PREPARATION_NODES.md) - Nodes for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data
3. [**Analysis Nodes**](./ANALYSIS_NODES.md) - Nodes for analyzing and extracting insights from data
4. [**Visualization Nodes**](./VISUALIZATION_NODES.md) - Nodes for creating visual representations of data
5. [**Machine Learning Nodes**](./MACHINE_LEARNING_NODES.md) - Nodes for training and deploying machine learning models
6. [**Output Nodes**](./OUTPUT_NODES.md) - Nodes for exporting, saving, and presenting results

## Node Architecture

Each node in Data Whisperer follows a consistent architecture:

- **Frontend Component**: A React component that renders the node in the workflow editor
- **Backend Processor**: A Python class that executes the node's functionality
- **Configuration Schema**: A JSON schema that defines the node's configuration options
- **Input/Output Interfaces**: Defined interfaces for the node's inputs and outputs

## Node Lifecycle

Nodes in Data Whisperer go through the following lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Node is added to the workflow
2. **Configuration**: User configures the node's parameters
3. **Validation**: Node configuration is validated
4. **Execution**: Node is executed when the workflow runs
5. **Completion**: Node completes execution and produces outputs

## Node Connections

Nodes can be connected to create a workflow:

- **Inputs**: Connection points where data flows into the node
- **Outputs**: Connection points where data flows out of the node
- **Connection Types**: Different types of connections (data, model, visualization, etc.)

## Node State

Nodes can be in one of the following states:

- **Idle**: Node is waiting to be executed
- **Learning**: Node is analyzing data to learn parameters
- **Working**: Node is currently executing
- **Completed**: Node has completed execution successfully
- **Error**: Node encountered an error during execution

## Node Validation

Nodes undergo validation to ensure they are properly configured:

- **Schema Validation**: Ensures the node's configuration matches its schema
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the node's inputs are valid
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensures the node's dependencies are satisfied
- **Custom Validation**: Node-specific validation rules

## Custom Node Development

Data Whisperer supports the development of custom nodes:

- **Node SDK**: A software development kit for creating custom nodes
- **Node Templates**: Templates for different types of nodes
- **Node Testing**: Tools for testing custom nodes
- **Node Publishing**: Process for publishing custom nodes to the node registry
