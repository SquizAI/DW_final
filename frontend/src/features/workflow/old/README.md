# Legacy Workflow Components

This directory contains legacy versions of workflow-related components that have been superseded by newer implementations.

## Contents

- **WorkflowPage.tsx**: The original workflow page implementation.
- **pages/WorkflowPageNew.tsx**: A simplified version of the workflow page that was temporarily used.
- **comparison/**: Contains components for comparing different workflow implementations.

## Usage Notes

These components are maintained for reference and backward compatibility. New development should use the current implementations located in:

- `frontend/src/features/workflow/WorkflowPageNew.tsx` (main workflow interface)
- `frontend/src/features/workflow/components/` (workflow components)

## Migration

If you're working with code that references these legacy components, consider migrating to the newer implementations for improved functionality and maintainability.
