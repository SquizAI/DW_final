# Kaggle Integration Status

## Current Status

The Kaggle integration is now working correctly. Users can:

1. Search for datasets on Kaggle
2. Download datasets from Kaggle
3. View locally downloaded datasets
4. Track download status
5. Delete datasets they no longer need

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed API Endpoint Paths**:
   - Updated the `kaggleApi` object in the frontend to use the correct endpoint paths without duplicate `/api` prefixes
   - Added the `/api` prefix to the datasets router in the backend's `main.py` file
   - Ensured consistent API path usage across the application
   - Fixed issue with double `/api` prefix in URLs (the axios instance already has `baseURL: '/api'` set)

2. **Verified Endpoint Functionality**:
   - Tested the Kaggle search endpoint: `/api/kaggle/search`
   - Tested the Kaggle local datasets endpoint: `/api/kaggle/local/datasets`
   - Tested the datasets API endpoint: `/api/datasets/`
   - Confirmed that datasets are properly registered in the database

3. **Ensured Data Persistence**:
   - Verified that downloaded datasets are stored in the correct location
   - Confirmed that dataset metadata is properly saved in the database
   - Checked that the datasets are accessible through the API

## How to Use

### Searching for Datasets

1. Navigate to the Kaggle Manager page at `/kaggle/manager`
2. Enter a search query in the search box
3. Click "Search" to find datasets on Kaggle
4. Browse the results and click "Download" on any dataset you want to use

### Viewing Local Datasets

1. Navigate to the Kaggle Manager page at `/kaggle/manager`
2. Switch to the "Local Datasets" tab
3. View details of downloaded datasets including file names, sizes, and paths

### Tracking Downloads

1. Navigate to the Kaggle Manager page at `/kaggle/manager`
2. Switch to the "Download Status" tab
3. Monitor the progress of ongoing downloads
4. View details of completed downloads

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the Kaggle integration, try the following:

1. **Check API Endpoints**: Make sure the API endpoints are correctly configured without duplicate `/api` prefixes
2. **Verify Kaggle Credentials**: Ensure your Kaggle API credentials are properly set up
3. **Check Network Connectivity**: Verify that you can connect to the Kaggle API
4. **Restart the Server**: Sometimes restarting the server can resolve issues
5. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages in the browser console

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for Kaggle API requests
2. **Enhance UI**: Improve the user interface for searching and managing Kaggle datasets
3. **Add Pagination**: Implement pagination for search results to handle large result sets
4. **Implement Caching**: Cache search results to improve performance
5. **Add Dataset Preview**: Allow users to preview datasets before downloading them
