# Database Persistence Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of database persistence in the Data Wrangler application.

## Overview

We've migrated from an in-memory storage solution to a robust PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM. This provides:

1. **Data Persistence**: Data is now stored in a reliable database, ensuring it persists across application restarts.
2. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL can handle large datasets and high concurrency.
3. **Data Integrity**: Database constraints ensure data consistency and integrity.
4. **Query Capabilities**: Advanced query capabilities for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.

## Implementation Details

### Database Configuration

- **SQLAlchemy**: Used as the ORM to interact with the database
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the database engine
- **Alembic**: Used for database migrations

### Database Models

We've created the following SQLAlchemy models:

1. **Dataset**: Represents a dataset in the system
   - Properties: id, name, description, file_path, created_at, updated_at, metadata

2. **Workflow**: Represents a data processing workflow
   - Properties: id, name, description, dataset_id, template, created_at, updated_at, created_by, is_ai_generated, metadata

3. **WorkflowNode**: Represents a node in a workflow
   - Properties: id, workflow_id, type, position_x, position_y, data

4. **WorkflowEdge**: Represents a connection between nodes in a workflow
   - Properties: id, workflow_id, source, target, source_handle, target_handle, type

### API Integration

We've updated the following API routes to use the database:

1. **Datasets API**: CRUD operations for datasets
2. **Workflows API**: CRUD operations for workflows
3. **Kaggle API**: Integration with Kaggle for dataset search and download

### Data Migration

We've created scripts to migrate existing data from JSON files to the database:

1. **migrate_data.py**: Migrates datasets and workflows from JSON files to the database
2. **run_init.py**: Initializes the database with sample data

### Docker Integration

We've updated the Docker configuration to include a PostgreSQL database:

1. **docker-compose.yml**: Added a PostgreSQL service
2. **Dockerfile**: Updated to include PostgreSQL client libraries
3. **entrypoint.sh**: Added database connection check and initialization

## Usage

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used for database configuration:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/datawrangler
DATABASE_ECHO=true
```

### Running Migrations

To create a new migration:

```bash
python -m app.create_migration
```

To run migrations:

```bash
python -m app.run_migrations
```

### Initializing the Database

To initialize the database with sample data:

```bash
python -m app.run_init
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Data is now stored in a reliable database, ensuring it persists across application restarts.
2. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL can handle large datasets and high concurrency.
3. **Performance**: Optimized queries for faster data retrieval and manipulation.
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns with models, schemas, and CRUD operations.
5. **Security**: Better control over data access and manipulation.

## Future Improvements

1. **User Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization.
2. **Data Versioning**: Implement versioning for datasets and workflows.
3. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data.
4. **Sharding**: Implement database sharding for horizontal scaling.
5. **Backup and Recovery**: Set up automated backup and recovery procedures.
