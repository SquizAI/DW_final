5. Enhance node visualization and feedback
6. Implement workflow templates gallery

## Development Tips
- Use `lsof -i :8000` to find processes using port 8000
- Use `kill -9 [PID]` to terminate lingering processes
- To kill all processes using port 8000: `kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:8000)`
- Use the provided script `./scripts/cleanup_backend.sh` to interactively clean up backend processes
- Use `./scripts/fix_reactflow_sizing.js` to fix ReactFlow container sizing issues
- Use `./scripts/fix_sidebar_dnd.js` to implement proper drag-and-drop functionality
- Check React DevTools for component hierarchy issues
- Use browser console to monitor network requests and errors
- Test both workflow page versions to determine the best approach
